Coffer - A Portable password manager 

As stated in **Kerckhoffs' principle** - *"The Security of a Crypto-System should depend solely on the  secrecy of the key and the private randomizer."
*

Another way of putting it is that a method of secretly coding and transmitting information should be secure even if everyone knows how it works.

And as said by a quote which I truly believe,*** "Many eyes make bugs shallow".***
